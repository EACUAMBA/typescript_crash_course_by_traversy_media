1. What is it?
   1. An open source language;
   2. A superset of JavaScript(ECMAScript);
2. Advantages
   1. Offer additional features to JavaScript including static types;
   2. Using types is completely optional;
   3. Comiles down to regular JS;
   4. Can be used for front-end JavaScript as well as backend with Node.JS;
   5. Includes most features from ES6 and ES7 (classes, arrow functions, etc);
   6. Types from 3rd party librares can be added with type definitions;

3. Dynamic vs Static Type Languages
   1. In dynamic type languages, the type are associated with run-time values and not named explicitly in your code.
   2. In static type languages, you explicitly assign types to variables, function parameters, return values, etc;

Static Examples are: Java, C, C++, Rust, GO /
Dynamic Examples are: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP

### Pros & Cons
#### Pros
1. More Robust;
2. Easily Spot Bugs;
3. Predicability;
4. Readability;
5. Popular;

#### Cons
1. More Code To Write;
2. More to Learn;
3. Required Compilation;
4. Not True Static Typing;

*Use it for large project or with project that you will work with a lot of people.*

### Compiling TypeScript
1. Uses .ts and .tsx as extensions;
2. TSC (TypeScript COmpiler) is used to compile .ts files down to .js files;
3. Can watch fies and report error at compile time;
4. Many tools include TS compilation by default;
5. Most IDEs have great support for TS;
